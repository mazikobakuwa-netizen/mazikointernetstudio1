		<h1>Favorite Movies Gallery</h1>
		<h2>Summary of Content</h2>
		<p>My favorite movies gallery is a compilation of my favorite genres. I am a huge fan of thriller and drama movies, espeically those centerered around criminal pursuits by governement/spy agencies. Because of this, most of the movies I watch either have the same director, producer, story line, or actors. Because of this passion, one would think I am a fan of the Bond series, but I feel that the plots are outdated (ironic based on my repetetive interest). I've found that I am a big fan of movies featuring actors like Liam Neeson, Chris Evans, Tom Hollander, and Jason Stratham,or produced by Harlan Cohen, Tom Clancy, and the likes. The only outlier to this list would be the movie <i>"Me Before You"</i> as it is a childhood favorite. </p>
