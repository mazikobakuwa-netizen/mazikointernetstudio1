  <h1>Week 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
    <h2>What I learned from Week 1 readings</h2>
      <h3>Required Reading 2</h3>
        <h4>Evolution of Web</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In 10 years,from the creation of Web 1 to the creation of Web 2,a participatory experience was possible allowing for users to interact with the content they were recieving</li>
            <li>Due to Web 2, the creation of social media platforms like Youtube, Facebook, MySpace and more became possible</li>
          </ul>
      <h3>Required Reading 3</h3> 
        <h4>The Wax and the Wane of the Web</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> When the writer began their web development journey, HTML and CSS were not used jointly.</li>
            <li> Instead of css style sheets, style tags were used to introduce fonts</li>
            <li>Developers struggle with integrating new methods and langauges because of the traditional methods they're already familiar with</li>
          </ul>
      <h2>Semester Project</h2>
         <p>For my semester proejct, I want to create a directory like site or automated database for like minded groups to organize, meet, and sign up. <br>There are many new social groups, such as: <br> 
           <ul>
             <li>run clubs</li>
             <li>pottery clubs</li>
             <li>hot yoga groups (different from traditional yoga)</li>
             <li>reading clubs</li>
             <li>streaming or content creator groups that even rent homes together for content</li>
           </ul>
          and more. This site will help these niche and hobby groups have a generalized place to organize their gatherings and convey group reminders and messages. It will consists of a search bar to find groups, recommendations based on interest survey, a newsletter for accomplishements and news of the groups, an integrated airtable of the list of groups to join, and more.<br>
          The inspiration of this plan was due to me being a transfer student and not feeling as if I belonged. It is common for other transfers to not find their footing, which leads to the development of school organizations I am apart of, such as Transfer Student Peer Mentor Program, where I help my mentee explore the DFW area. I hope that others can find ways to belong in a group of their common interest or even step outside their comfort zone when moving to the DFW area.
