            <h2>About the Design</h2>
            <p>This website showcases Bali, Indonesia through a carefully crafted design system that balances aesthetics with functionality. The color palette features warm earth tones (##EFDECD, #DEB887) paired with ocean-inspired blues (##6495ED, #05336e,#87CEEB), reflecting Bali's colorful crystal clear water blue hues and sandy beaches. These colors not only create visual harmony but also improve readability and emotional connection with the content.</p>

            <p>Typography plays a crucial role in establishing the website's personality. The headings use 'Original Surfer', a playful typeface that adds whimsical fun to capture the essence of Bali while maintaining readability, while body text employs 'Noto Sans Serif' for optimal legibility across devices. </p>

            <p>Interactive elements like buttons feature smooth transtitions to other pages and areas within the page for a quick scroll. This reduces the tediousness of navigation, allowing you to read information that the user would find relevant. Call-to-action buttons use dark contrasting colors (#6495ED; #05336e;#FFFFFF) 
 
				and are strategically placed in the middle of each section to maintain consistent user interaction patterns. The buttons are rounded to reduce intimidation, as rounded corners reduce the seriousness and add dynamic design to the screen. Images are carefully curated to showcase Bali's cultural heritage and natural beauty, with a 16:9 aspect ratio for hero images and 1:1 for gallery thumbnails, ensuring visual consistency across the site.</p>

            <p>High-quality images were selected from various tourist sites and tourist uploads to showcase the stunning scenery and attractions of Bali, aiming to inspire potential travelers. The use of buttons for smooth scrolling enhances user interaction and accessibility, making it easy for visitors to find relevant information quickly.</p>
          
            <p>Overall, the design aims to capture the essence of Bali while providing a user-friendly interface that encourages exploration and engagement with the content.</p>
